            <h3> Storyline: </h3>
           <p> Everyone has a favorite superhero, but how many know that hero's origins? From this visualization, we are able to see how Marvel's most famous heroes were created around the 1960's, and also how notice the years in which more characters were created. Additionally we can also see the stats to theses characters, info, and a random story in which they were featured in to provide more history on the characters. </p>
            
            <p>Instructions: To use the visualization simply hover over any character's profile on the timeline and a full
            description of their origin, year they were created, alter ego, and stats will appear on the left. Centered above the timeline will be a randomly generated story that they were featured in that will also contain its publication date. To the far right of the timeline will be the synopsis of the story that was randomly generated. The red timeline can be dragged around to view more characters while the grey timeline will simply illustrate a navigator that indicates your overall position on the timleline when you drag the red timeline. Zomming in on the red timeline is also a feature, and the navigator will scale accordingly. We don't reccomend clicking on the grey timeline at all as it still contains a few bugs that need to be fixed.</p>
